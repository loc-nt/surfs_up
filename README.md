The descriptive analysis between the months of June and December provides good insights regarding the seasons of Oahu for Avy.

Regarding the temperature, the winter seems to have lower temperature with a mean of 71 compared to 75 in summer. The standard deviation in winter is a little higher, implying a larger spread of temperature. That also explained a much lower minimum temperature in winter (56 vs. 64), even though the maximum number is fairly even (about 83-85 degree). The histogram shows quite even spread for both months, and not significantly skewed. Regarding the precipitation, the winter looks like to have a little more rain than summer since all the descriptive statistics are higher in December. The histograms, however, show a very densed frequency on zero to one, so the rain might not be significantly too much.

For better results and insights, I'd recommend extending to the others months in the two seasons to have a larger sample size, thus giving more reliable results. Secondly, in order to predict other possibilities, retrieving other weather data will help for the analysis, such as wind speed and/or humidity. Next, we can look at closed and currents open business data in Oahu to gain more information on the ice cream and surfing businesses in the local. For example, we can try to see if there is any correlation between the opening months and the success for the current businesses (such as, in term of profitability, or taxes, or active durations). Last but not least, we can get the tourist data to analyse the number of tourists visiting Oahu to see if there are any significant changes between the two seasons.
